This is the *Logistic Regression from Scratch* project I made myself.


<p>In this project, we will take a look at the logistic regression algorithm and build a custom binary classifier. The main idea of the project is to implement gradient descent for two different cost functions, devise a method to predict the probability that a given sample belongs to a certain class, and analyze training errors. And last but not least â€” put your models to the test on a real dataset.
